Arabic to Roman Numerals Challenge
==================================

Did you know our numeral system - the symbols we use to represent numbers are called Arabic numerals? Fun fact, because now it gets serious. You're going to be translating Arabic to Italian.

Write a function called `arabic_to_roman`  an integer as an argument and return a roman numerals string. For example:
```
60 >> LX  
78 >> LXXVIII  
99 >> XCIX  
3000 >>> MMM  
```
Look up Roman Numerals to get a complete list and jog your memory on its ancient conventions. This is an easy challenge to code, but can be a difficult mental exercise. Don't overcomplicate it!

Add your own assert statements to the bottom to test your code.
